            How to deal with Stress:
            Stress is a factor that has only been increasing throughout the generations within kids. According to a scientist, kids in this age have the same amount of stress and anxiety as a 1950â€™s patient in asylums. Stress will only be increasing in our lives so we must learn how to cope with it. 
            Some signs that you are stressed out:
            Being angry and impatient in general
            Always being overwhelmed
            Having anxiety or being nervous all the time
            Thoughts racing in your head
            Depressed
            Lost joy in life
            Here are just some of the many symptoms of stress, which may vary from person to person. The important thing is that we know how to deal with it. 
            Here are a few tips for dealing with stress:
            Identify the sources of your stress and try to eliminate them or minimize their impact on your life. This might involve changing your job, getting more exercise, or finding ways to relax and unwind.
            Make time for activities that you enjoy and that help you to relax, such as meditation, yoga, or reading.
            Exercise regularly, as physical activity can help to reduce stress and improve your overall physical and mental health.
            Try to maintain a positive outlook and focus on the good things in your life. This can help to counteract the negative effects of stress.
            Talk to others about your stress and seek support from friends, family, or a mental health professional if you need it.
            Remember that everyone deals with stress differently, and what works for one person may not work for another. It's important to find a healthy and effective way to manage stress that works for you.
            As I have stated earlier, people have different forms of coping with anxiety and you should try to find yours as well!
